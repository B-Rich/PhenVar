        PhenVar is designed to take one or more rsids and generate a list of PubMed IDs to query and generate novel
        associations between publications. It utilizes a local sqlite cache in a configurable location to keep a
        local copy of relevant srids, pmids, and the abstrat blobs for the pmids.
