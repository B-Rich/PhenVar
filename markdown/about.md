PhenVar was developed and prototyped during the January 2017 NCBI hackathon to fill the need for keeping abreast of experimental studies identifying phenotypes associated with genomic variants. Following the NCBI-assisted hackathon rules (Busby et al. 2016), PhenVar is free, opensource and publically in the [NCBI-Hackathon repository](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/).

The source code for PhenVar is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/PhenVar/tree/python3).
