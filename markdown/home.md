PhenVar is designed to take one or more rsids and generate a list of PubMed IDs to query and generate novel associations between publications. It utilizes a local sqlite cache in a configurable location to keep a local copy of relevant srids, pmids, and the abstract blobs for the pmids.

The source code for PhenVar is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/PhenVar).
