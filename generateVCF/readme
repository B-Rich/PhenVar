1. annotateVCF.py

This script currenly runs on its own. Its input is the file from Lon Phan that has the allele frequency information. 

After downloading, because the separator is not consistent, a simple awk command:
awk '{print$1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t"$4"\t"$5"\t"$6"\t"$7"\t"$8"\t"$9}' PubMedAlleleFreqByRs1000G_All.txt > PubMedAlleleFreqByRs1000G_All_tab.txt will change to tab delimited. 

Note that because there are 135296 entries in the file PubMedAlleleFreqByRs1000G_All_tab.txt, it is faster to break it down to smaller file size. For testing, I did 100:

To run: python annotateVCF.py PubMedAlleleFreqByRs1000G_All_tab_100rs.txt > snp_ids_annotation.txt
